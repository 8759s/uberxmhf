# Introduction

XMHF is a modular hypervisor platform for recent multicore x86 hardware with support for dynamic root of trust and nested (2-dimensional) paging.  It is NOT a full virtual machine monitor.

XMHF takes a developer-centric approach to hypervisor design and implementation, and strives to be a comprehensible and flexible platform for performing hypervisor research and development. XMHF encapsulates common hypervisor core functionality in a framework that allows others to build custom hypervisor-based solutions (called "hypapps"). It currently supports only a single "rich" guest OS.
