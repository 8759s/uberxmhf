DRTM Design
===========

XMHF includes three significant components: an untrusted `init`
module, the trusted Secure Loader (SL), and the hypervisor runtime.
`init` is engineered to dynamically launch the SL.

Fundamental to XMHF's design is support for a ***measured launch***.
Presently we insist that it be a dynamic launch, on a platform that
supports Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM).  AMD and Intel
implement this differently, so we first point out some
platform-specific issues before discussing our design.

AMD
---

* Reference manuals:
    * [AMD64 Architecture Programmerâ€™s Manual Volume 2: System Programming](http://support.amd.com/us/Processor_TechDocs/24593_APM_v2.pdf)

* The CPU instruction for a dynamic launch is `SKINIT`.
* AMD calls the launched environment a Secure Loader Block (SLB).
* It is necessary to clear any microcode patches on all APs (and BSP) before attempting SKINIT.
* The SLB must start on a 64KB-aligned physical address.
* Execution of the SLB starts in 32-bit flat protected mode.  Only CS and SS are valid.  EAX contains the SL base address.  EDX contains some CPU information. ESP initialized to the top of 64K.
* **Important**: Upon entry into the SLB, CS and SS are valid. DS is not.
* It is possible for launch to fail.  The SLB will still get control but PCR 17 will not hold the correct value.
    * TODO: Check for this failure and respond accordingly (retry launch).

Intel
-----

* Reference manuals:
    * [Intel MLE Developer's Guide](http://download.intel.com/technology/security/downloads/315168.pdf)
    * [Intel SW Dev Guide Vol 2B, Ch. 6: Safer Mode Extensions](http://www.intel.com/Assets/PDF/manual/253667.pdf)

* The CPU instruction for a dynamic launch is `GETSEC[SENTER]`.
* Intel calls the launched environment the Measured Launched Environment (MLE).
* `TXT.*` MSRs (model-specific registers) control aspects of DRTM
    * TXT.ERRORCODE, TXT.STS, TXT.ESTS, TXT.E2STS registers contain status information.
    * In the event of a failed launch, TXT.ERRORCODE is our best chance of understanding what went wrong.
    * [tboot](http://tboot.sourceforge.net) contains some utilities to read this information.
* We must be able to learn the start address and size of the SL from within `init`.
* We must be able to construct page tables that map the MLE so that Intel's [Authenticated Code Module](http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-trusted-execution-technology/) (ACMod, also known as SINIT) can address it properly.  In practice three 4KB pages should suffice.  These are PAE-formatted page tables.
* We must be able to access the appropriate SINIT module (start address and size) for the current chipset. This gets configured in the bootloader (i.e., `grub`).
* This module will need to be copied to the physical addresses specified in some of the TXT MSR's; future systems may already include an SINIT module that was put in place by the BIOS.  We have yet to see one in the wild.
* No base address available in a register (AMD put it in EAX).  call/pop/align may be needed to learn base address.  However, newer systems will put the base of the MLE page tables into ECX.  We can determine if a system supports this by using GETSEC[CAPABILITIES].
    * TODO: Is it reasonable to depend on this support? Suspect that all newer SINIT modules do provide this feature. Obviously we want to fail with meaningful output if this assumption turns out to be invalid.
* Upon entry into MLE, CS and DS are valid.  SS is not (opposite of AMD).  One can read memory with CS but must use DS to write.
    * Experimentally, it appears that SS is actually valid, but it still points into the segment described by the SINIT module's GDT.  The SINIT module must protect itself from all of the same attacks (i.e., DMA and other CPUs), so it may not be unreasonable to use SS.
    * TODO: Reach a conclusion regarding the use of SS prior to initialization.

Secure Loader Design / Implementation
=====================================

* SL header must somehow remain compatible with both AMD and Intel.
    * SL starts with 3 empty pages, except for the first 4 bytes.  These are initialized to contain the SLB header for an AMD system.  The entry point points beyond these three pages to the true entry point on the fourth page.  On an Intel system these three pages will be overwritten with the MLE page tables.  The MLE header will be written into the MLE at the beginning of the fourth page.
* To determine the SL's base addresses, the best cross-processor solution is to do:
    * `call 1f`
    * `1: pop eax`
    * This might introduce a problem if the default Intel stack pointer points into the runtime, where some important memory contents could be clobbered.  Likely work-around will be to manually set the stack pointer to 64K.  It will have to come after the type of processor is detected.  Again, I don't think this causes any trouble.
* Because writing memory can only be done with SS on AMD, and DS on Intel, we have to write differently depending on the processor.  This affects 3 locations in the code where the SL's GDT is dynamically updated.
* TODO: If GETSEC[CAPABILITIES] indicates that ECX will contain the MLE base address pointer upon entry into the MLE, we can use ECX as the base address on Intel systems.  This prevents errant memory writes from a not-entirely-understood SS on Intel.  Thus, we can scrap the call/pop/align and use EAX on AMD, and ECX on Intel.

Additional Intel-related issues
-------------------------------

* MTRRs must be set with caching disabled for SINIT to run, so system performance post-launch is poor.  These are currently restored in `runtime.c:allcpus_common_start()`.
    * NOTE: This may be too late to get good boot performance, since the SL runs (and builds page tables) without appropriate caching.
* Bringing APs online requires TXT-specific mechanisms.

TODOs
=====

* Block guest access to TPM localities > 1.
* Understand STM and use it
* Understand DMA protections and use them
