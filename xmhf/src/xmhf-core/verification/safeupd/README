Building analysis modules into cil (notes):
Author: Amit Vasudevan (amitvasudevan@acm.org)

The official CIL documentation:
http://kerneis.github.io/cil/doc/html/cil/

	1. Download the latest CIL package from the distribution site:
		a. http://sourceforge.net/projects/cil/files/cil/
		b. Version as of this writing was: cil-1.7.3.tar.gz
	2. Unpack cil-1.7.3.tar.gz which unpacks the sources into ./cil-1.7.3/
	3. Install ocaml (and dependencies)
		a. Sudo  apt-get install ocaml
	4. Cd ./cil-1.7.3
	5. ./configure
		a. Gave an error initially:
			checking for ocamlfind... no
			configure: error: You must install OCaml findlib (the ocamlfind command)
		b. Sudo apt-get install ocaml-findlib 
		c. The above command resolved the problem and configuration went smooth after that
	6. Make
	7. Make install

	
To add additional analysis modules (E.g., logmwrite.ml)

cd ./cil-1.7.3/
./configure EXTRASRCDIRS=/home/amit/repos/xmhf.git/xmhf/src/xmhf-core/verification/safeupd EXTRAFEATURES=logmwrite
make
make install

This resulted in a build failure.
It so happens that this is a known bug with cil versions (> 1.7.0)
see: http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=31297356

downgrading to v1.7.0 or v1.6.0 did not make any difference.

cd ./cil-1.7.0/
./configure EXTRASRCDIRS=/home/amit/repos/xmhf.git/xmhf/src/xmhf-core/verification/safeupd EXTRAFEATURES=logmwrite
make
sudo make install

make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/amit/tools/cil/cil-1.7.0'
make: *** No rule to make target `/home/amit/repos/xmhf.git/xmhf/src/xmhf-core/verification/safeupd/*.mli', needed by `install-findlib'.  Stop.

It does seem like the final executable/libraries get generated in the 
obj/ folder, but logmwrite.mli is missing.
