This directory contains an extremely stripped down libc.
Primarily, it contains the mem*() and str*() functions
that are part of string.h.

The intention is to provide basic libc computational support
for hypervisor internals, extremely minimized PALs, and
other environments where TCB / code size is a priority, and
using 'newlib' constitues too much TCB / code size.
