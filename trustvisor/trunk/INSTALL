	Linux Kernel source code (with TrustVisor patch)		linux-2.6.21.i686.std.tar.gz

1 Build Linux Kernel
  1.1 untar the Linux kernel source code with TrustVisor patch
	tar xzvf linux-2.6.21.i686.std.tar.gz 
	cd linux-2.6.21.i686
  1.2 Disable SMP and Virtualization support inside configuration file
	make oldconfig
	make menuconfig
  1.3 build linux kernel	
	make
      or
        make -j n
      n depends on how many CPUs on your machine
  1.4 install linux kernel
	make modules_install install
2 Build TrustVisor
  2.1 untar the TrustVisor source code
	cd trustvisor
  2.2 build TrustVisor
	make
  2.3 install TrustVisor
	cp visor_out/TrustVisor.gz /boot/
	cp loader/loader_out/TLoader.gz /boot/
  2.4 config grub for TrustVisor, add a entry in /boot/grub/menu.lst as the following:
	title TrustVisor (up)
		root (hd0,0)
		kernel /TLoader.gz
		module /TrustVisor.gz
		module /vmlinuz-2.6.21-prep ro root=LABLE=/ mem=1536M
		module /initrd-2.6.21-prep.img

	note: you should specify the root device in the entry based on the configuration of your machine

3 Reboot machine to see how TrustVisor works

4 Additional notes:
  4.1 Debug Support
      there are serial port output support embedded in TrustVisor, you can see all the boot message and 
      runtime message by default the serial console. the default serial port is ttyS0, which corresponding
      to port 0x3f8, you can change it to 0x2f8 if your machine use ttyS1. At the beginning of drivers/uart.c 
      in TrustVisor source code, you can find how to change this definition.
  4.2 Kernel version
      currently we tried 2.6.20.14 and 2.6.21 from Fedora. But theoretically, you should be able to use
      any Linux Kernel with TrustVisor, you only need to disable SMP and virtualization support inside Linux
      Kernel
      Another thing is that, the bootloader of TrustVisor assumes the existense of initrd, so you'd better
      use Linux Kernel from Fedora for simplicity.
