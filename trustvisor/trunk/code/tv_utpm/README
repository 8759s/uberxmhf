This directory contains the core implementation of the "MicroTPM" as proposed
for TrustVisor.  It is intended to be independent of TrustVisor, and equally
amenable to testing entirely within userspace from a suitable test harness.

../app/hc_utpm.c and ../app/include/hc_utpm.h are the TrustVisor-specific code
that binds this MicroTPM implementation into the hypervisor itself.
