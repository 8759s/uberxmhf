libbaremetal is composed of several sub-libraries as listed below:

libemhfc - extremely stripped down libc
libemhfutil - misc. utilitity functions
libemhfcrypto - crypto library
libtpm - stand alone TPM library
libtv_utpm - core implementation of the "MicroTPM" as proposed
			by the TrustVisor EMHF hyperapp, but intended to be
			independent

libbaremetal and sub-libraries are constructed to be built using 
an out-of-tree build process:

e.g.,
cd mybuilddir
make -f <path-to-libbaremetal-src>/Makefile

libbaremetal can also be built in-tree by using the command:

make

this will result in the objects and sub-libraries being generated
in the _objects directory.
