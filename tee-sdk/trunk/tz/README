This is an implementation of ARM's [TrustZone] API. This API provides
an abstract interface for applications to communicate with _services_
running in a trusted execution environment. While the API shares its
name with ARM's TrustZone technology, which can be used to _provide_ a
trusted execution environment, it is not specific to that technology.

[TrustZone]: http://www.arm.com/products/processors/technologies/trustzone.php

To write an application utilizing this library, you should familiarize
yourself with ARM's [Specification] of the TrustZone API.
