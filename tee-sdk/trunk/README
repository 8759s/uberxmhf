This is the Trusted-Execution-Environment Software-Development-Kit
(tee-sdk). It comprises tools and documentation for developing
_services_ that run in a trusted environments, and _clients_ that
communicate with those services. Initially, this means writing PALs
that run under TrustVisor, and applications that use PALs. However,
the APIs provided here are intended to provide sufficient abstraction
such that additional back-ends can be implemented, allowing services
and applications to be ported to use alternative trusted environments
with little or no modification.

A few terms:

Service
  ~ A piece of code running in a trusted execution environment
    provided by a _device_. (e.g., a PAL)
Client
  ~ An application that communicates with one or more _services_.
Device
  ~ A module providing a trusted execution environment (e.g., TrustVisor)

Files:

  * [README](README) This file.
  * [tz](tz) TrustZone API. This library is to be used by _clients_
    to communicate with _services_. This library supports multiple
    _device_ back-ends, abstracting them in such a way that most _client_
    code can be oblivious to which back-end is in use.
  * [ports](ports) Support libraries for _services_. These have been
    ported to run in a trusted environment provided by some _device_.
  * [examples](examples) Examples and tests.
