What is W5300?</a></h2>
<b>W5300</b> is a 0.18um CMOS technology single chip into which 10/100 Ethernet controller, MAC, and TCP/IP are integrated. <b>W5300</b> is designed for Internet embedded applications where easy implementation, stability, high performance, and effective cost are required. <b>W5300's</b> target application is the embedded internet solution requiring high performance such as multi-media streaming service. Comparing to existing WIZnet chip solution, <b>W5300</b> has been improved in memory and data process. <b>W5300</b> is the most appropriate to the products of IPTV, IP-STB and DTV transferring multi-media data with high-capacity. The Internet connectivity can be implemented easily and quickly only with single chip having TCP/IP protocol and 10/100 Ethernet MAC &amp; PHY.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>High-Performance Hardware TCP/IP single chip solutions</b><br>
 <b>WIZnet</b> retains the technology of full hardware logic of communication protocols such as TCP, UDP, IPv4, ICMP, IGMP, ARP and PPPoE. In order to provide high-performing data communication, the data communication memory is extended to 128Kbyte and 16bit bus interface is supported in <b>W5300</b>. Users can utilize independent 8 hardware <code>SOCKETs</code> for high-speed data communication.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>More flexible memory allocation for various applications</b><br>
 The memory for data communication can be allocated to each <code>SOCKET</code> in the range of 0~64Kbytes. It is more flexible for users to utilize the memory according to their application. Users can develop more efficient system by concentrating on the application of high performance.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Easy to implements for beginners</b><br>
 <b>W5300</b> supports BUS interface as the host interface. By using direct and indirect access methods, <b>W5300</b> can easily interfaced to the host as like SRAM memory. The data communication memory of <b>W5300</b> can be accessed through TX/RX FIFO registers that exist in each <code>SOCKET</code>. With these features, even beginners can implement Internet connectivity by using <b>W5300</b>.</li></ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="how_W5300">
How to use W5300?</a></h2>
<b>W5300</b> can provide Internet connectivity simply by setting <a class="el" href="group___i_i_n_c_h_i_p___r_e_g.html">some register</a>.<br>
 <b>WIZnet</b> provides <a class="el" href="group___i_i_n_c_h_i_p___i_o___f_u_n_c.html">basic I/O funtions</a>, <a class="el" href="group___s_o_c_k_e_t___a_p_i___f_u_n_c.html">WIZnet SOCKET APIs</a> and this document for your Internet connectivity application. You can learn how to initialize <b>W5300</b> and communicate according to the protocol types (TCP, UDP) by reviewing example code. <br>
 For example, Wiznet provide "TCP SERVER/CLIENT loopback" and "UDP loopback" program. Refer to <a class="el" href="main_8c.html#9a88639b57af45dfd4b61ca8021a8c03" title="It executes example program such as loopback_tcps(), loopback_tcpc(), and loopback_udp()...">Main()</a>.<p>
<ul>
<li><b>"TCP SERVER loopback" program </b><br>
 This program works as "TCP SERVER" mode, and <b>AX1</b> program of the testing PC works as "TCP CLIENT" mode. <b>AX1</b> tries to connect to <b>W5300</b> and if the connection is successful, <b>AX1</b> transmits the data stream through the connection <code>SOCKET</code>. This program returns back the data stream from <b>AX1</b> without processing through the connection <code>SOCKET</code>. <br>
 Refer to <a class="el" href="main_8c.html#062f59a52ece70087544ff0ebca079b4">loopback_tcps()</a>.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b> "TCP CLIENT loopback" program </b><br>
 This program works in "TCP CLIENT" mode and <b>AX1</b> works in "TCP SERVER" mode. This program tries to connect to <b>AX1</b> which is waiting as "TCP SERVR", if the connection is successful and <b>W5300</b> receives data stream through the connection <code>SOCKET</code>, and then this program sends back the received data stream to <b>AX1</b>.<br>
 Refer to <a class="el" href="main_8c.html#a5f07c61e1d5f459a8d6ea62c70449ad" title="&quot;TCP CLIENT&quot; loopback program.">loopback_tcpc()</a>.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b> "UDP loopback" program </b><br>
 This program uses unicast datagram communication of UDP protocol. This program operates same as "TCP SERVER/CLIENT loopback" program does. UDP communication includes unicast datagram communication and broadcast datagram communication, and basically supports 1-to-many communication that is used for many destinations with one <code>SOCKET</code>. <br>
 Refer to <a class="el" href="main_8c.html#ed2243d169a9c70157f547f7ab650dc8" title="UDP loopback program.">loopback_udp()</a>. </li></ul>
