Note: The disk-image used for the demo is designed to work 
only on the hp8540p laptop

Requirements
------------
1. Lockdown demo disk image
2. Lockdown verifier device (as of this writing based on a 
		DS2148WZ board)
3. HP 8540p Laptop
4. 120GB SATA laptop hard-disk

Initial Setup
-------------	
1. Burn Lockdown demo disk image to the 120GB SATA laptop hard-disk
   e.g., using dd on a different machine
	
2. Plug in the 120GB SATA hard-disk into the HP 8540p laptop and boot

3. At the first GRUB menu, press the <up-arrow> key to disengage
   autoboot and select the "Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS Service Console"
   and boot into it
	
4. Program the Lockdown Verifier (see xxx)

5. Build the Lockdown hypervisor (see xxx)

6. Build the Lockdown environment monitor (see xxx)

7. Copy hypervisor and monitor binary images to 
   /mnt/bootpartition/boot

8. Copy /mnt/bootpartition/grub/menu_ue.lst 
	to /mnt/boot/partition/grub/menu.lst

9. Power down the laptop. You are now ready for the demo 


running the demo

connect the verifier to the laptop and ensure its button is set to
untrusted environment (red)

power on the laptop 

it will automatically boot into the untrusted environment
once you are in the blinking red will glow solid red

do your ops in the untrusted environment

slide the verifier switch to trusted and lockdown will prepare
to switch, verifier light will switch to blinking red and system
will boot into the trusted environment

once trusted environment has booted up, verifier will glow soild green
signifying you are ready for sensitive ops.


note: the first time you do the untrusted to trusted cycle it might
take a little longer since the hibernation images are not built up
subsequent transitions should be much faster.
