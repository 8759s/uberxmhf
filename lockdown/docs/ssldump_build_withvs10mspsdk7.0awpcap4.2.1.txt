building ssldump
author: amit vasudevan (amitvasudevan@acm.org)

premise:
ssldump can build on windows only with visual c++ 6.0
and winpcap 2.3. both of them are outdated. in fact
winpcap 2.3 doesnt work with the new NDIS drivers on
windows 2003 and above.

getting ssldump to work with the following configuration
proved to be a challenge:

winpcap: version 4.1.2
microsoft visual c++/studio 2010 express edition command line environment
microsoft windows platform sdk v7.0A

i came up with the steps as outlined below to succesfully
build and get ssldump to work. 

1. unpack ssldump-0.9b3.tar.gz to get
   "path\ssldump-0.9b3". i will call this
	SSLDUMP_BASE_DIR from this point on.


2. unpack 2.3-WPcapSrc.zip into
   SSLDUMP_BASE_DIR\win32

3. unpack 2.3-WPdpack.zip into
   SSLDUMP_BASE_DIR\win32

4. unpack WpdPack_4_1_2.zip into
   SSLDUMP_BASE_DIR\win32\wpcaplibs

5. patch the ssldump source base with the following
   diff
	patch-ssldump-0.9b3



6. fire up a VS/VC++ command line build environment
   and from SSLDUMP_BASE_DIR issue the following
   command

   nmake /a /f win32\vcwin32.mak all

   ignore the warnings (there will be a lot of them)

7. final executable should be at:
   SSLDUMP_BASE_DIR\out32\ssldump.exe
