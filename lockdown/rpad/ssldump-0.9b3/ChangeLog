Fri Aug 16 16:56:23 2002 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
	* Cleaned up 56-bit ciphersuites in ciphersuites.c
	
	* Fixed memory errors in packet copying.

	* Fixed bugs in processing of bogus SSLv2 messages.

	* Fixed bugs in TCP packet reassembly code.
		
Tue Aug 13 13:03:41 2002 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
	* Fixed EXPORT1024 DES cipher suites
	
Mon Aug 12 16:49:51 2002 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
        * Added support for VLAN networks (Jeffrey Hafey)

	* Fixed printing of data with embedded tabs (Pavel Curtis)

	* Added support for non-promiscuous mode (-P flag)
	  (Bruce M Simpson)

Fri Sep 28 15:54:47 2001 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
	* Fixed install so that we install in /usr/local/sbin
	  with mode 755. Bug report ssldump/22.
	  (Dave Jagoda)

	* Fixed compilation warning about create_null_analyzer
	  Bug report ssldump/23.

Wed Sep 26 14:49:06 2001 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
	* Fixed SYN & SYN/ACK detection to that it works with ECN.
	(Henrik Nordstrom)
	 
	* Added /usr/include/pcap to the PCAP search path
	(Henrik Nordstrom)

Sat Sep 15 13:41:10 2001 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
	* Fix to ssldecode.c to remove error with empty
	  struct when compiling with VC++ and no OpenSSL
	  (Greg Stark)

	* Change to vcwin32.mak to print out that you're not
	  using OpenSSL (Greg Stark)

	* Automatic version changing courtesy of version-change.pl
	
Fri Sep 14 15:22:29 2001 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
	* Fixed bug 4. Delete the MS after decrypting a PMS
	  to force new MS generation in the key generation phase.
	  This makes decryption of renegotiated connections work
	  correctly. This got broken when session resumption 
	  was added.
	
2001-09-14  Eric Rescorla  <ekr@rtfm.com>

	* Imported Greg Stark's Win32 port

Sun Sep  2 15:53:06 2001 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
        * Fixed the reassembler so it doesn't crash when
	   FIN/RST segments have data.

	* closure/connection freeing now works, thus meaning less
	  memory leakage and less crashing.

	* A bunch of trivial makefile/configure fixes.
	  
Fri Jul 20 16:40:51 2001 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
	* Removed loading of certificate file. This served
	  no real purpose. Fix for bug 5.

Fri Jul 20 11:02:09 2001 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
	* Fixed initialization so that the key file is loaded
	  only once. 

	  Removed default keyfile and password. You now must
	  specify them. You also get an error if you specify
	  a bad password or keyfile.

Fri Jul 20 10:17:36 2001 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
	* Added support for session resumption.
	
Fri Jul 20 10:17:16 2001 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
	* Fixed SEQ_LT problems on Linux and other compilation
	  problems.

Tue Mar 6 2001 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
	* Removed statically allocated conn array. We can now
	  have an arbitrary number of 
	
Thu Nov  9 12:14:15 2000 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
	* Cleanups to the man page and cleaned up some cases
	  where printing didn't work quite right. 
	
Mon Nov  6 10:22:25 2000 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
	* Added the -X flag to force hex-only printing when
	  binary data is displayed as hex dumps.
	
Fri Nov  3 09:23:35 2000 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
	* cleaned up the case where multiple handshake messages
	  are in the same SSL record.

Fri Nov  3 09:14:39 2000 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
	* Modified printing so that when we're printing hex dumps
	  of application data traffic we also print the printable
	  sections of the data itself in a column on the side.

Thu Nov  2 14:14:21 2000 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
        * Modified cipher suite printing so that the names have
	  SSL_ if we're doing SSLv3 and TLS_ if we're doing TLS.
	  Suggestion by Eric Murray.
	
Thu Nov  2 13:07:09 2000 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
	* Fixed an ABW in ssldecode.c that caused crashes
	  on Solaris. Also, fixed a bunch of memory leaks
	  using Purify.
	
Thu Nov  2 08:45:42 2000 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
	* Various Portability fixes
	  CC=gcc -> CC=@CC@ in Makefile
	  Removed FLAGS in Makefile (it was a noop)
	  in base/tcpconn.c, changed {} to {0} to appease HPUX's compiler
	  made create_null_analyzer.c static as it should be.
	  Removed the final (bogus) entry in null_vtbl.
	  made sslx__print_serial() static to match its prototype
	  Rearranged library order for better linkage
	  Thanks to Lutze Jainecke for these fixes.
	
Thu Nov  2 08:41:10 2000 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
	* Added -r as a synonym for -f. -f will eventually
	  be removed and reused for some other option.
	  This was done for option compatibility with tcpdump
	  and on the theory that someday I might add a -w.

	* Renamed -h to -H and added it to the documentation.
	  -h now triggers usage info.
	
Thu Nov  2 08:38:06 2000 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
	* Removed blank lines in the man page. This confuses some
	  man page formatters. (Thanks to Hugh Mandeville for pointing
	  this one out)
	
Thu Nov  2 08:37:59 2000 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
	* Wired up -N (it was unwired)
	
Thu Nov  2 08:37:47 2000 EKR <ekr@rtfm.com>
	* Added -D_BSD_SOURCE=1 when you're compiling on Linux.
	  (Allowing it to compile)
